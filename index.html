            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is super helpful in today's world. One of the main problems that it solves is the file sharing problem. People are able to check files out, edit them, and then out them right back. Some major benefits of the version control include that there is a repository that holds all the latest files, different individuals can work on the same file at the same time, and files an not be over written. Also, if you need to check back to the earlier version of your file, you can do so. This is very helpful in group projects and group proffessions.</p>

            <p class="lead">A local repository is very relevant to our class because it is what we are currently using on Cloud9. It is defined as, "A repository that resides on a local machine of an individual user. In that case, all of the files are uploaded to the device you're working on whether it's a computer or laptop. This is very helpul to an individual keeping track of previous projects such as we are in this class.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a Version Control System that is designed to handle files and projects with speed and efficiency. This version control system makes everything easier for users with big projects. The user of Git will have access to all the files stored locally, and it is impossible for unintentional file overwrite. Git analyzes the data in a much more efficient way than other systems that will help us review old files or edit and save without losing any of our old projects.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is defined in the notes as, "a repository that resides on a remote server that is shared by multiple team members." In other words, it is a repository where an individual can share files, along with everyone else, in the same repository. The very first thing that came to mind when reading this was Google Docs. Google Docs lets you work on a project with people and edit the same file and share with everyone where they can see it. It is just another version control system.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When you start a project on Github like we did for this assignment, you have to set up a Git Repository. It asks if we should work on pre-existing project or connect from another server, as we did with Cloud9. Once the two servers are connected, it's very easy to undo mistakes and work on projects through the version control system.</p>
