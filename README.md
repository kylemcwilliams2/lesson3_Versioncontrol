## Project Description:
This assignment was all about getting familiar with version control systems and the different types of repositories. 


## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. It was important to learn what a version control system actually was even though many students have already worked with it. Just knowing the name of what was going on was beneficial. 
2. Learning the benefits of a version control system was also very helpful because it's important to know the reason why we use it instead of another method. It helped me understand the concept better. 
3. I learned the difference between local repositories and remote repositories. This helped because we are using repositories in our assignments.
